	<h3>
	<p><ins>     The amount of energy in an item of food or drink is measured in calories</ins>. When we 
	eat and drink more calories than we use up, our bodies store the excess as body fat. 
	If this continues over time we may put on weight.</p>

     <p> As a guide, an average man needs around 2,500kcal (10,500kJ) a day to maintain a healthy body weight.
         For an average woman, that figure is around 2,000kcal (8,400kJ) a day.
		 These values can vary depending on age, size and levels of physical activity, among other factors.
     </p>

	<h4>
      <b><ins>Calories and energy balance</ins></b> 
     <p> Our bodies need energy to keep us alive and our organs functioning normally. When we eat and drink, 
	 we put energy into our bodies. Our bodies use up that energy through everyday movement, which includes everything 
	 from breathing to running. </p>
      <p> To maintain a stable weight, the energy we put into our bodies must be the same as the energy we use by normal 
	  bodily functions and physical activity. An important part of a healthy diet is balancing the energy you put into your 
	  bodies with the energy you use.For example, the more physical activity we do the more energy we use. If you consume 
	  too much energy on one day, don't worry; just try to take in less energy on the following days.</p>
 </h4>
 <h5>
     <b><ins>Checking calories in food</ins></b>
      <p>Knowing the calorie content of food and drink can help ensure you're not consuming too much.
       The calorie content of many shop-bought foods is stated on the packaging as part of the nutrition label.
       This information will appear under the "Energy" heading. The calorie content is often given in kcals, which is 
	   short for "kilocalories", and also in kJ, which is short for "kilojoules".
        A "kilocalorie" is another word for what is commonly called a "calorie", so 1,000 calories will be written as 
		1,000kcals.
</h5>
 <h6>
    <b><ins>Burning calories</ins></b>
     <p>The amount of calories people use by doing a certain physical activity varies, depending on a range of factors, 
	 including size and age.
       The more vigorously you do an activity, the more calories you will use. For example, fast walking will burn more 
	   calories than walking at a moderate pace.If you're gaining weight, it could mean you've been regularly eating and 
	   drinking more calories than you've been using.</p>
      <p>To lose weight, you need to use more energy than you consume, and continue this over a period of time.</p>
